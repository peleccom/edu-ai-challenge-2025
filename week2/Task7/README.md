# Sea Battle Game - Unit Testing Implementation

## Overview
This project contains a Sea Battle game implementation with comprehensive unit tests using Jest. The tests cover all critical game logic functionalities to ensure the game works correctly.

## Features Tested

### Core Game Functions
- **Board Creation**: Tests board initialization with correct dimensions and default values
- **Ship Placement**: Tests random ship placement without overlaps and within boundaries
- **Player Guess Processing**: Tests input validation, hit/miss logic, and ship sinking detection
- **Ship Status**: Tests ship sinking detection logic
- **Coordinate Validation**: Tests boundary checking and duplicate guess prevention

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual function testing
2. **Integration Tests** - Complete game flow testing
3. **Edge Cases** - Boundary conditions and error handling
4. **Validation Tests** - Input validation and error scenarios

## Test Coverage

### Tested Components
- ✅ `createBoard()` - Board initialization
- ✅ `isValidAndNewGuess()` - Coordinate validation
- ✅ `isSunk()` - Ship sinking detection
- ✅ `processPlayerGuess()` - Player input processing
- ✅ `placeShipsRandomly()` - Ship placement logic
- ✅ Game state management
- ✅ Edge cases and error handling

### Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 34
- **Test Suites**: 1
- **Status**: All tests passing ✅
- **Execution Time**: ~0.2-0.6 seconds (fast execution)
- **Code Coverage**: 80.73% statements, 74.44% branches, 90.9% functions
- **Coverage Threshold**: Minimum 70% required for all metrics

## Running Tests

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

**Coverage Threshold**: Tests will fail if coverage drops below 70% for any metric (statements, branches, functions, lines). This ensures code quality is maintained over time.

## Version Control

### Git Configuration
The project includes a comprehensive `.gitignore` file that excludes:

- **Dependencies**: `node_modules/`, `jspm_packages/`
- **Coverage Reports**: `coverage/`, `*.lcov`
- **Logs**: `*.log`, `npm-debug.log*`
- **IDE Files**: `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `*.swp`
- **OS Files**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`
- **Environment Files**: `.env*`
- **Build Artifacts**: `dist/`, `build/`
- **Cache Files**: `.npm`, `.cache`

### Included in Version Control
- `package-lock.json` - For consistent dependency versions
- Source code (`seabattle.js`, `seabattle.test.js`)
- Configuration files (`package.json`, `.gitignore`)
- Documentation (`README.md`)

├── processPlayerGuess()
├── placeShipsRandomly()
├── Game Logic Integration
└── Edge Cases

### Key Testing Features
- **Mocked Console Output**: Tests run silently without cluttering output
- **Isolated Test Environment**: Each test runs independently
- **Comprehensive Edge Cases**: Tests boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Fast Execution**: All tests complete in under 1 second
- **Clear Test Descriptions**: Each test has descriptive names and clear assertions

## Game Logic Tested

### Board Management
- Board creation with correct dimensions (10x10)
- Custom board sizes
- Cell initialization with water symbols (~)

### Ship Placement
- Correct number of ships placed
- Ships within board boundaries
- No overlapping ships
- Proper ship structure (locations and hits arrays)
- Horizontal and vertical placement

### Player Interactions
- Input validation (format, bounds, duplicates)
- Hit detection and marking
- Miss detection and marking
- Ship sinking detection
- Multiple ship handling

### Game State
- Guess tracking
- Board state updates
- Ship damage tracking
- Game flow integrity

## Design Approach

The tests use a modular approach by:
1. **Direct Function Testing**: Tests import and test the actual functions from `seabattle.js` for real code coverage
2. **Module Exports**: The game file exports functions while maintaining standalone playability
3. **Mock External Dependencies**: Console output and readline are mocked to prevent I/O during tests
4. **State Management**: Game state is properly reset between tests using a custom `resetGame()` function
5. **Helper Functions**: Test utilities for creating test ships and managing game state
6. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover normal operation, edge cases, and error conditions

## Benefits

- **Reliability**: Ensures core game logic works correctly
- **Real Code Coverage**: Tests actual production code, not duplicated test implementations
- **Quality Gates**: Coverage threshold of 70% ensures minimum test coverage is maintained
- **Maintainability**: Easy to add new tests as features are added
- **Debugging**: Quick identification of broken functionality
- **Confidence**: Safe refactoring with comprehensive test coverage (80.73% statements)
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior
- **Dual Functionality**: Game remains fully playable as standalone while being thoroughly tested

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for additional testing:
- CPU AI behavior testing
- Game loop integration
- Performance testing for large boards
- Multiplayer functionality (if added)
- UI interaction testing (if GUI is added)
