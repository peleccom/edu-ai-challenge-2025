Imagine three different experts are answering this question.
Experienced Developer,  a Security Engineer and a Performance Specialist.
For each expert perspective, provide specific, *actionable* recommendations and observations to improve the code.

All experts will write down  their thinking, then share it with the group.
Make 2 circles.
Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc.
After the full circle of experts summarize the expers thoughts.


Question is to analyse this code from each expert perspective
```
def process_user_data(data):
    users = []

    for i in range(len(data)):
        user = {
            "id": data[i]["id"],
            "name": data[i]["name"],
            "email": data[i]["email"],
            "active": True if data[i]["status"] == "active" else False
        }
        users.append(user)

    print("Processed " + str(len(users)) + " users")

    return users

def save_to_database(users):
    # TODO: Implement database connection
    success = True
    return success
```
