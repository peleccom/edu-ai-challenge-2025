brings you in here today? I'm just having this really sharp pain in my chest and I'm scared. I

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:16,240
think I'm having a heart attack. Oh wow, um you know that must be really scary. Yeah. When did

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:26,879
this uh when did this pain start? So about three days ago. Three days ago? Okay and where exactly

4
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:35,599
in your chest do you feel it? It's kind of right here, right over my heart I think. That's where

5
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:43,520
it's the worst. Okay and is it uh what kind of pain is it? Is it more like a dull pressure

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,680
pain or is it a sharp pain? How would you describe it? I'd say it's a sharp pain.

7
00:00:49,680 --> 00:01:00,480
A sharp pain? Okay and um so it started three days ago. Has it been coming and going or has

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:10,320
